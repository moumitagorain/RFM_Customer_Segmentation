# RFM_Customer_Segmentation

The goal of RFM Analysis is to segment customers based on buying behavior. We need to understand the historical actions of individual customers for each RFM factor. We then rank customers based on each individual RFM factor, and finally pull all the factors together to create RFM segments for targeted marketing.
